In ENGRD 2020, students were given the following problem: 

Given a 2D design space of 150cm in length and 50cm tall, a rigid bar of a fixed length (of your choice), three pin supports of which two need to be mounted on the ground and a linear actuator, design a frame/mechanism to lift the maximum possible weight to the highest possible height. Assume all the supports and bar/actuator are rigid.

In my approach to this problem, I relied mainly on relationships I know between the angle, the height, and the weight lifted. My design starts with a 50 cm rigid bar, in order to maximize height due to the design space being just 50 cm tall. One of the three pins in the design is at the leftmost side of the bar, attached to the ground and the bar. This pin allows for the bars rotation about the z-axis and provides reaction forces and moments in every other sense.

The remaining two pins should be the mounting of the base of the linear actuator to the ground and at the point connecting the top of the linear actuator to the bar. To think about where these pins should be, we should compare the consequences of placing the actuator at different points along the bar. I determined that, because in this case we are only concerned with the maximum height and weight, it is ideal to put the actuator at 50cm, meaning 50 cm to the right of the first pin along the ground and along the bar. With the linear actuator at this point, it will need to extend farther to get the bar up to maximum height compared to if it is placed closer to the center of the bar. However, with the linear actuator placed at the end, the lever arm is maximized in length, allowing for the absolute maximum lift force to equal the desired actuator's force. In this case, the stroke needed will be longer and thus may be more expensive but that will be ignored in this problem in order to maximize height while lifting the maximum weight.
